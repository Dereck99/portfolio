            This is my tribute page for Peter Clemenza from the Godfather movie. Clemenza was a loyal Caporegime for the Corleone family. He was one of Vito Corleone's closest friends and helped him enter a life of crime as a way to make money when Vito lost his job to Fanuiccis nephew. Clemenza was both brutal and intelligent. Vito felt he could trust him to not take things too far when a "message" needed to be sent. I have some pictures of him and a list of things that he is known for.
